# Week 11

The programs this week focused on binary search trees (BST). I combined all the programs into one for ease of use.

## bst_ops.c

A menu driven program to perform the following binary search tree operations:

```
1. Insert element
2. Delete element
3. Search for element
4. Traverse
5. Exit
```

Build command for linux(with GCC):

```shell
gcc -O3 -o output_file_name.out bst_ops.c
```
